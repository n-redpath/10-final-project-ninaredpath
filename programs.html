        <p>New Day Farm is happy to offer more than just our produce to our community. 
            Our beautiful farm located in the heart of Vermonts Green Mountains is a beautiful 
            place to host events, or spend the summer working!</p>

        <h5>New Day Farm Rangers</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Summers on the farm in Vermont are memorable. Every spring and summer we offer a limited number of positions to young people willing to work hard, get dirty, learn new skills, and build lasting friendships and maybe even a passion for farming!

            </p>
        <p>We have a limited number of paid and volunteer internship positions available from April - October. There is a two week minimum stay.
            ​
            Tasks range form orchard care, weeding and maintenance, bottling, Biodynamic preparations, forest clearing, and more. We try to change it up so that things don't get too dull, or hot, or wet - you get the picture.
             
            Places fill up early in the year - so contact us as soon as possible!</p>
            ​
            <p>  We are independent, not on the WWOOF program.
            ​
            Please contact us for more information if you are interested in working on the farm!</p>

            <p>New Day Farm is a beautiful place to host events from weddings, 
                to music festivals. One of our past events is pictured above!</p>

            <p>Our July, 2016 Room at the Table benefitted the International Rescue Committee.  
                We offered a delicious open-air meal with open dialogue on refugees and the IRC's 
                New Roots program helping US-resettled refugees get involved in agriculture.
            </p>
